This repository contains all the artefacts for my work on Anomaly Detection with ML

* Project n. 1: Anomaly detection and Predictive Mainteinance with Bearings Data
* Project n. 2: Anomaly detection with ECG data (ECG5000)

### Project1:

* Data from NASA Prognostic Repository: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/
* see Bearing Data Set

* Predictive mainteinance using data from ball bearings.
* Analysis with PyOD and AutoEncoders

### Project2:

* Dataset ECG5000 from Physionet

ECG fragment analysis to identify those with anomalies
Autencoder and Conv1D (acc > 0.99)
